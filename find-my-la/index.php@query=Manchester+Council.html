      <h2>How big is the problem?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="mt-5">
      <p>Manchester is currently paying {council_annual_interest} in interest per year. For a sense of scale, this corresponds to <a href="index.php@query=Manchester+Council.html#"><b>50%</b></a> of what the council collects in council tax.</p>
      <p>It is projected to spend at least  <a href="index.php@query=Manchester+Council.html#"><b>£200</b></a> in interest payments over the remaining term of the loans, the last one ending in  <a href="index.php@query=Manchester+Council.html#"><b>2072</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The interest rates for this council’s LOBO loans are between 4.14% and 6.837%. Currently Councils can borrow from central government (via the Public Works Loans Board) at much lower rates (between 1% and 2%) and on much more favorable terms. To illustrate, on a loan of £10m over a 50 year term, at 4% the council will pay £20m in interest while at 2% they will pay £10m.</p>
      <p>Some loans are also more toxic than others. This is based on the fact that LOBO loans contain embedded derivatives. The toxicity of a loan varies over time depending on how financial markets value it. The more toxic the loan is for the council, the higher the projected profitability for for the Bank.</p>
      <p>Below is an outline of the LOBO loans currently held by Bracknell Forest.</p>

      <h2>What can I do about it?</h2>
      <p>Some Banks are allowing Council’s to exit their LOBO loans early with a reduced penalty fee. If you hold LOBO loans with these banks, we have listed them below.</p>
      <p>For each bank we have indicated the councils that have exited their loans, and if known, what penalty they paid. You can see how much the council saved, by comparing the penalty fee with the outstanding interest at the time of exit. The penalty fee is also dependent on how profitable the loan would have been for the bank if it had kept it. Therefore the penalty fee is also influenced by the toxicity of the loan at the time of exit, which is also an indication of the projected profitability for the bank.</p>
      <p>For all the banks you hold loans with, whether they have allowed exits or not, we have listed the council they hold LOBO loans with.</p>
      If you decide to take action, we recommend you speak with your Finance Director and share with them the information on this site, including the downloadable data pack for your council. We also suggest you get in touch with councils that have already exited their loans, to learn from their experience. If some councils still have loans with the same banks as your council you might want to consider collaborating on exiting to the loans.</p>
      <p>If you struggle to find support within your council, consider seeking independent financial advice. Alternatively get in touch with us for further guidance.</p>
